    <br><p>Pickling is the process of preserving 
        vegetables or extending the shelf-life of food 
        by fermentation using a brine or immersion in 
        vinegar. The acidity of the solution alters 
        the flavor and texture of the food while 
        favoring the growth of desirable, benign 
        bacteria (Lactobacillus) and also preventing 
        the growth of harmful bacteria like the one 
        that causes botulism, Clostridium botulinum.</p>
