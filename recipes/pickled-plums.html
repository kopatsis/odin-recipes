    <p>Inspired by li hing mui—salty-sweet dried 
        plums that are a popular snack in China— 
        chef Minh Phan pickles fresh plums in a 
        salty-sweet spiced brine. She suggests serving 
        the plums in a refreshing soda made by 
        mixing them with their pickling liquid 
        and sparkling water</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups unseasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cups dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds ripe plums, cut into eighths</li>
        <li>8 cloves</li>
        <li>4 star anise pods</li>
        <li>1 2-inch cinnamon stick, brokenn in fourths</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pink peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water, cover 
            and bring to a boil. Add the canning jars, 
            lids and rings along with a set of tongs 
            and a ladle and simmer over low heat for 
            about 10 minutes to sterilize. Cover the 
            pot and turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Set a metal rack in another large pot. 
            Fill the pot with water, cover and bring 
            to a boil.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan, combine both vinegars with 
            the brown sugar and salt and bring to a 
            boil to dissolve. Using the sterilized 
            tongs, remove the jars from the hot water 
            and transfer them to a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Pack the plums, cloves, star anise, 
            cinnamon, peppercorns and fennel seeds 
            into the jars, leaving 1/2 inch at the 
            top. </li>
        <li>Ladle the hot brine over the plums, 
            stopping 1/2 inch from the top. Using 
            the tongs, screw the lids and rings on 
            the jars securely but not too tightly.</li>
        <li>Using canning tongs, lower the jars onto the 
            rack in the boiling water, making sure they 
            are covered by 1 inch of water. Boil over 
            high heat for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the jars to a rack to cool until the lids seal.</li>
        <li>Store the sealed jars in a cool, dark place for up to 6 months.</li>
    </ol>
