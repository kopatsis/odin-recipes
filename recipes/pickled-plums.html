    <p>Inspired by li hing mui—salty-sweet dried 
        plums that are a popular snack in China— 
        chef Minh Phan pickles fresh plums in a 
        salty-sweet spiced brine. She suggests serving 
        the plums in a refreshing soda made by 
        mixing them with their pickling liquid 
        and sparkling water</p>
